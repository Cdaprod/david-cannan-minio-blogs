.
Initializing Clients
Establishing a solid foundation for the ETL process begins with the initialization of our MinIO and Weaviate clients.
from minio
import
Minio
import
weaviate
# Setup
for
MinIO and Weaviate
minio_client = Minio(
"play.min.io:443"
, access_key=
"minioadmin"
, secret_key=
"minioadmin"
, secure=True)
print
(
"MinIO client initialized."
)
client = weaviate.Client(
"http://localhost:8080"
)
print
(
"Weaviate client initialized."
)
This process involves configuring each client with specific parameters such as access credentials and connection URIs.
Data Extraction and Transformation with Unstructured-IO’s Auto-Partitioning
This stage involves dynamically fetching web data, and utilizing a combination of requests for web scraping and Unstructured-IO for partitioning the content into manageable segments.
The code begins by importing necessary libraries—
requests
for HTTP operations,
re
for regex operations aiding in sanitizing of our URLs for a more descriptive object naming,
io
for handling byte streams, and
unstructured.partition.auto
for intelligently breaking down complex web content into structured data.
Two key helper functions,
sanitize_url_to_object_name
and
prepare_text_for_tokenization
, are employed to clean URLs and text content, ensuring the output is in a standardized format conducive to analysis. The
sanitize_url_to_object_name
function modifies URLs to create unique, filesystem-friendly names for each content piece, facilitating organized storage. The
prepare_text_for_tokenization
further cleans the text data, stripping unnecessary whitespace and preparing it for deeper analysis or AI processing.
import
requests
import
re
import
io
from unstructured.partition.auto
import
partition
def sanitize_url_to_object_name(url):
clean_url = re.sub(r
'^https?://'
,
'', url)
clean_url = re.sub(r'
[^\w\-_\.]
', '
_
', clean_url)
return clean_url[:250] + '
.txt
'
def prepare_text_for_tokenization(text):
clean_text = re.sub(r'
\s+
', '
', text).strip()
return clean_text
# Dictionary/List of URL to process
urls = [
"https://blog.min.io/",
"https://weaviate.io/blog",
"https://unstructured.io/blog"
]
This structured approach not only streamlines the ingestion of web data into our system but also lays the groundwork for subsequent stages, where this data will be stored in MinIO and indexed in Weaviate. By carefully selecting URLs as data sources, the process ensures a rich, varied dataset is available for exploration, ready to drive insights and decision-making in a wide array of contexts.
Loading to MinIO
This step is for ensuring that the newly structured and cleaned data is preserved in an organized manner, facilitating easy access for future analysis.

After data undergoes transformation, the next step involves securely storing it within MinIO, a process depicted in the following code-block:
bucket_name =
"cda-datasets"
if
not minio_client.bucket_exists(bucket_name):
minio_client.make_bucket(bucket_name)
print
(f
"Bucket '{bucket_name}' created."
)
The script automates the checking for an existing MinIO bucket or creates a new one if necessary, demonstrating the pipeline’s preparedness to handle data efficiently.
for
url in urls:
print
(f
"Fetching URL: {url}"
)
try:
response = requests.get(url)
response.raise_for_status()  # Check
for
HTTP issues
html_content = io.BytesIO(response.content)
elements = partition(file=html_content, content_type=
"text/html"
)
combined_text =
"\n"
.join([e.text
for
e in elements
if
hasattr(e,
'text'
)])
combined_text = prepare_text_for_tokenization(combined_text)
object_name = sanitize_url_to_object_name(url)
with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(
delete
=False, mode=
"w"
, encoding=
"utf-8"
, suffix=
".txt"
) as tmp_file:
tmp_file.write(combined_text)
tmp_file_path = tmp_file.name
minio_client.fput_object(bucket_name, object_name, tmp_file_path)
print
(f
"Stored '{object_name}' in MinIO bucket '{bucket_name}'."
)
os.remove(tmp_file_path)  # Clean up
except requests.RequestException as e:
print
(f
"Failed to fetch URL {url}: {e}"
)
except Exception as e:
print
(f
"Error processing {url}: {e}"
)
By systematically processing and uploading each data piece into MinIO, the approach underscores the importance of reliable storage solutions in maintaining the integrity and availability of data for subsequent retrieval and analytical endeavors.
Streamlining Data Utilization with Weaviate
After the data has been transformed, the next step is to funnel this refined information into Weaviate.

This phase is required for augmenting the data with Weaviate’s advanced search capabilities and securing it within an efficient storage system. The Python code snippet outlines a systematic approach for importing transformed data, specifically text files, into Weaviate from MinIO.
The process not only showcases the seamless integration between the storage and search platforms but also highlights the practical application of the Dual ETL pipeline in enhancing data accessibility and analytical readiness.
for
obj in minio_client.list_objects(bucket_name, recursive=True):
if
obj.object_name.endswith(
'.txt'
):
print
(f
"Processing document: {obj.object_name}"
)
file_path = obj.object_name
minio_client.fget_object(bucket_name, obj.object_name, file_path)
elements = partition(filename=file_path)
text_content =
"\n"
.join([e.text
for
e in elements
if
hasattr(e,
'text'
)])
data_object = {
"source"
: obj.object_name,
"content"
: text_content}
client.data_object.create(data_object,
"Document"
)
print
(f
"Inserted document '{obj.object_name}' into Weaviate."
)
os.remove(file_path)
This segment of the pipeline emphasizes the transformation of static data into dynamic, searchable assets within Weaviate. By embedding the data within Weaviate’s contextually aware environment, it unlocks the potential for nuanced query capabilities and data-driven insights. This step encapsulates the essence of the Dual ETL approach—leveraging the combined strength of MinIO’s scalable storage and Weaviate’s intelligent search to foster a data ecosystem that is both robust and responsive to analytical queries.
Querying Weaviate—Finalizing Our Data Process
The concluding phase in our data pipeline employs Weaviate’s semantic search capabilities, querying the transformed data to extract meaningful insights.

This process translates the structured data into practical, actionable intelligence.
query_result = client.query.get(
"Document"
,
[
"source"
,
"content"
]
).with_near_text({
"concepts"
: [
"s3"
],
"certainty"
:
0.6
}).do()
for
result in query_result[
'data'
][
'Get'
][
'Document'
]:
print
(f
"Source: {result['source']}"
)
# Display only the first
100
characters of the content
print
(f
"Content: {result['content'][:100]}...\n"
)
The Python code demonstrates a targeted search within Weaviate, retrieving documents that semantically match given concepts with a defined level of certainty.
This functionality exemplifies the practical power of our Dual ETL pipeline—turning complex data into comprehensible and useful information ready for business applications.
